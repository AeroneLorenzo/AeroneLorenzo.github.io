		</p>
		<h2 id="2nd">Step 2</h2>
		<p class = "step2">
	Bring Knorr Complete Recipe Mix Ginataang Gulay dissolved in water to a boil then bring down to a simmer until thick. Let this cool.

		</p>
		<h2 id="4th">Step 4</h2>
		<p class="step4">
   Pour mixture in a greased round baking pan lined with banana leaf then cook in between coals or in an oven. When 
   bibingka is halfway set, top it with salted eggs and cheese.

		<p>This was very good and texture came out perfect. I followed the recipe as written except reduced the sugar to about 1/2 cup because I was worried it was going to be too sweet with the macapuno strings. 
		Also lined the pan for easy clean up. Thanks for sharing! -jeannie</p>

		<p class="food-review-2">Our neighbors are from the Philippine s, and we always swap different meals....mine are always Italian. I wanted to surprise them with something from their country. The Bobingka was 
			so easy to make, and delicious. The hardest part was finding the sweet rice flour. I finally ordered it on Amazon -Gino1321.</p>

		<p class="food-review-3">I've looked all over the 'net for recipes for Biningka and love this one the best. It's so easy to make and you have a wonderful treat in just over an hour. I also use a can of coconut 
			milk for part of the milk and find it quite delicious.-Loren J.</p>
