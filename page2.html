<p class="gluttons">I am part Filipino and generations of my family have always browned the chicken pieces first, in a little oil with one small, chopped onion in a separate skillet - <br>
 then transfer to soup pot or dutch oven. Browning the chicken with onion first makes a huge difference to the flavor. I use 1/4 cup red wine vinegar and 1 cup water <br>
 .Eliminate the white vinegar and peppercorns. Add a little salt if needed. You can also substitute fresh garlic with a generous amount of garlic powder or granulated garlic. 
 It's delicious! -Cathy Adams Perez</p>

 <br>
<p class="food-review-2">OMG the chicken is amazing!!! The only change I made was that I had Skinless Chicken Leg Quarters, multi colored 
    Pepper corns and after straining I cooked frozen Stir fry veggies in the sauce. Recipe lends itself to using chicken that isn't quite thawed. The cooking style ensures they thaw and cook corretly. 
    I served it over a bowl of steamed Rice. Get a rice cooker and some good rice - it makes a meal like this. -Karlie</p>

<p class="food-review-3">I m ake chicken adobo got it from a sweet little Phooipine lady years ago. Very similar to this recipe. Everthing
     the same except she told me 1/3 cup vinegar to 2/3 cup soy sauce. she also use 1 pkc Lipton cream of chicken soup and 1 cup water but I just use the can of soup too now.
     I debone my chicken sometimes or cut up whole chicken and cut breast and thighs in half for more portions. I just made it last night for friends and family my picky 10 year old son was begging for more today. -AllRecipes Member</p>
