        "Suman Malagkit is a Filipino delicacy made from glutinous rice cooked in sweetened coconut milk and a pinch of salt until half-done. The mixture is wrapped in banana leaves and then boiled or steamed until soft and chewy.

        The sticky rice cake is usually served with brown sugar, latik, caramel sauce, or a side of juicy mangoes. It's a filling snack or dessert and delicious with a cup of hot chocolate, coffee, or tea.-kawalingpinoy"

<p class="electroCute"> Ingredients and recipe gathered from pilipinasrecipe.com and kawalingpinoy.com </p>
<div id="procedure">
    <h2 id="1st">Step 1</h2>
    <p class="step1">
     In a bowl, place rice and enough cold water to cover. Soak for about 1 hour and then drain well.
    </p>
    <h2 id="2nd">Step 2</h2>
    <p class = "step2">
        Meanwhile prepare banana leaves by trimming stiff ends. Cut into 10 x 10 inch squares. If leaves
     feel stiff, briefly pass over gas flames for about 10 to 20 seconds until pliable.
    </p>
    <h2 id="3rd">Step 3</h2>
    <p class="step3">
    In a pot, combine coconut milk, sugar, and salt. Stir until sugar and salt are dissolved. Add rice and stir to disperse.
    </p>
    <h2 id="4th">Step 4</h2>
    <p class="step4">   
     Cover and cook rice over medium-low heat until liquid is absorbed.   
    </p>
    <h2 id = "5th">Step 5</h2>
    
    <p class ="step5"> Remove from heat and allow to slightly cool. Place about 2 to 3 heaping tablespoonfuls on a banana leaf and shape into 
        logs, leaving about 1 inch on sides. Roll banana leaves tightly around the rice to form a log and fold both edges to seal. </p> 

    <h2 id = "6th">Step 6</h2>
    <p class ="step6">In a pot, arrange suman with folded side down and add enough water to cover at about 1-inch. Place a layer of banana leaves 
        over suman and a plate on top to weigh them down. Cover pot with lid.</p>
    <h2 id = "7th">Step 7</h2>
    <p class ="step7">Over medium heat, cook for about 45 minutes to 1 hour or until rice is fully cooked. With tongs, remove suman from water and allow to cool. </p>
    <h2 id = "8th">Step 8</h2>
    <p class ="step8">To serve, peel leaves and drizzle suman with coconut caramel sauce.</p>
    <h2 id = "latik">For coconut caramel sauce</h2>
    <h2 id = "uno">Step 1</h2>
    <p class = stepA>In a saucepan over medium heat, combine coconut milk, brown sugar, and salt and whisk together until sugar and salt are dissolved.</p>

<p class="gluttons">I am part Filipino and generations of my family have always browned the chicken pieces first, in a little oil with one small, chopped onion in a separate skillet - <br>
 then transfer to soup pot or dutch oven. Browning the chicken with onion first makes a huge difference to the flavor. I use 1/4 cup red wine vinegar and 1 cup water <br>
 .Eliminate the white vinegar and peppercorns. Add a little salt if needed. You can also substitute fresh garlic with a generous amount of garlic powder or granulated garlic. 
 It's delicious! -Cathy Adams Perez</p>

<p class="food-review-2">OMG the chicken is amazing!!! The only change I made was that I had Skinless Chicken Leg Quarters, multi colored 
    Pepper corns and after straining I cooked frozen Stir fry veggies in the sauce. Recipe lends itself to using chicken that isn't quite thawed. The cooking style ensures they thaw and cook corretly. 
    I served it over a bowl of steamed Rice. Get a rice cooker and some good rice - it makes a meal like this. -Karlie</p>

<p class="food-review-3">I m ake chicken adobo got it from a sweet little Phooipine lady years ago. Very similar to this recipe. Everthing
     the same except she told me 1/3 cup vinegar to 2/3 cup soy sauce. she also use 1 pkc Lipton cream of chicken soup and 1 cup water but I just use the can of soup too now.
     I debone my chicken sometimes or cut up whole chicken and cut breast and thighs in half for more portions. I just made it last night for friends and family my picky 10 year old son was begging for more today. -AllRecipes Member</p>
