        "Suman Malagkit is a Filipino delicacy made from glutinous rice cooked in sweetened coconut milk and a pinch of salt until half-done. The mixture is wrapped in banana leaves and then boiled or steamed until soft and chewy.

        The sticky rice cake is usually served with brown sugar, latik, caramel sauce, or a side of juicy mangoes. It's a filling snack or dessert and delicious with a cup of hot chocolate, coffee, or tea.-kawalingpinoy"

<p class="electroCute"> Ingredients and recipe gathered from pilipinasrecipe.com and kawalingpinoy.com </p>
<div id="procedure">
    <h2 id="1st">Step 1</h2>
    <p class="step1">
     In a bowl, place rice and enough cold water to cover. Soak for about 1 hour and then drain well.
    </p>
    <h2 id="2nd">Step 2</h2>
    <p class = "step2">
        Meanwhile prepare banana leaves by trimming stiff ends. Cut into 10 x 10 inch squares. If leaves
     feel stiff, briefly pass over gas flames for about 10 to 20 seconds until pliable.
    </p>
    <h2 id="3rd">Step 3</h2>
    <p class="step3">
    In a pot, combine coconut milk, sugar, and salt. Stir until sugar and salt are dissolved. Add rice and stir to disperse.
    </p>
    <h2 id="4th">Step 4</h2>
    <p class="step4">   
     Cover and cook rice over medium-low heat until liquid is absorbed.   
    </p>
    <h2 id = "5th">Step 5</h2>
    
    <p class ="step5"> Remove from heat and allow to slightly cool. Place about 2 to 3 heaping tablespoonfuls on a banana leaf and shape into 
        logs, leaving about 1 inch on sides. Roll banana leaves tightly around the rice to form a log and fold both edges to seal. </p> 

    <h2 id = "6th">Step 6</h2>
    <p class ="step6">In a pot, arrange suman with folded side down and add enough water to cover at about 1-inch. Place a layer of banana leaves 
        over suman and a plate on top to weigh them down. Cover pot with lid.</p>
    <h2 id = "7th">Step 7</h2>
    <p class ="step7">Over medium heat, cook for about 45 minutes to 1 hour or until rice is fully cooked. With tongs, remove suman from water and allow to cool. </p>
    <h2 id = "8th">Step 8</h2>
    <p class ="step8">To serve, peel leaves and drizzle suman with coconut caramel sauce.</p>
    <h2 id = "latik">For coconut caramel sauce</h2>
    <h2 id = "uno">Step 1</h2>
    <p class = stepA>In a saucepan over medium heat, combine coconut milk, brown sugar, and salt and whisk together until sugar and salt are dissolved.</p>
    <h2 id = "dos">Step 2</h2>
    <p class = stepB>Bring mixture to a boil. Continue to cook, stirring regularly, for about 20 to 25 minutes or until mixture is reduced and thickened</p>

<p class="gluttons">Very simple and delicious! My Dad, who was raised in the Philippines, was very happy to eat them! I can’t wait to bring some

<p class="food-review-2">I’m going to try this recipe, it looks easy & straight forward. My husband who is Caucasian loves Suman. I have a Filipina
     friend who made some to buy, I purchased a dozen. I told my hubby it’s good with chocolate sauce which we didn’t have. Well he sprinkled some powder 
     chocolate milk. He said it was good, he’s pretty resourceful. Thanks for sharing this recipe & I will you know how it turned out. -Eidy Monteclaro</p>

<p class="food-review-3">I can’t believe I made such a heaven sent recipe! I have been nagging my Mom how we make our Ilokano “patupat” and these were 
    exactly the same taste minus the pandan flavor. The caramel sauce is to die for and a winner! I woke up at 4 am just to experiment it, brought in to work
     still piping hot and my Caucasian colleagues raved about it! It was the talk for my 12 hours shift lol. They asked me how I made it and I redirected them 
     to your site. Thank you so much, God bless you more for sharing your talent! -Marlene</p>
